    <h2>Improving text rendering in Bonsai</h2>
    <h4>An adventure in anti-aliasing for Fun and Profit</h4>
    <h5>Nov 1, 2022</h5>

    <hr>

    <p>
      The spoils of this adventure are the sweet, sweet anti-aliased pixels on
      the borders of text.  If you're looking for a harrowing tale of riches
      and glory, I'd suggest a good high-fantasy novel.
    </p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      After an initial pass on text rendering in Bonsai, there were glyphs on the screen!
    </p>

    <p>
      Granted, they look like they were drawn by Windows in 1990.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, that's being generous.  In 1990, Windows looked quite a bit better than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Surely we can do better!
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      The font rasterizer I wrote does a pretty good job of producing nice, AA'd
      glyph bitmaps, however, the engine itself was doing a very poor job of
      actually putting those glyphs on the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day I found myself fafing (read: working) on the 2D layout system and
      spuriously commented out this line of shader code:
    </p>

    <code> if (bitmapTexel.a &lt; 0.5f) { discard; }</code>

    <p>
      The text all of a sudden looked INCREDIBLE!  At least compared to just a
      moment ago.
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/good_text_aliasing.png"></img>

    <p>
      So, the decision was made.  My next task would be to cleanup text rendering.
    </p>

    <h3>Issues</h3>
    <p>
      There were three main issues contributing to aliasing, which we'll
      deconstruct further:

      <ol>
        <li>The drawing code didn't properly support transparency (very bad, no good, don't do this)</li>
        <li>The transparent AA'd pixels were gettind discarded by the fragment shader</li>
        <li>The glyph textures were stored in a 3D texture, instead of 2D texture array</li>
      </ol>
    </p>


    <h3> Issue 1: Supporting transparency </h3>
    <p>
      The root cause of the aliasing behavior is the 2D renderer did not
      support transparency in any real way.  Instead of doing it the "real way"
      on my first pass, I decided to quickly hack in something that would
      achieve the goal of drawing text, quality be damned.  Thus, this line was
      born:
    </p>

    <code> if (bitmapTexel.a &lt; 0.5f) { discard; }</code>

    <p>
      This line discards any texel that's less than 50% opaque, which partly
      explains the aliasing.  But, you may ask, why not just turn that down to
      0.001%?  Furthermore, what happens if you just delete that line entirely?
      Surely we shouldn't need such weirdness in this fine establishment?!
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll have to look at some different text to demonstrate the problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the threshold set very low (0.001f):
    </p>
    <img></img>

    <p>
      With the discard off entirely:
    </p>
    <img></img>

    <p>
      Obviously, the background bleeding through the edges of text (or the
      entire glyphs quad!) is objectionable and certainly not something us
      folks of such standards and grace should tolerate!  So what's a programmer
      to do?
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, the answer lies somewhat hidden by an architectural decision that
      was made w.r.t copying geometry to the video card.  The 3D renderer in
      Bonsai uses glMapBuffer to reserve fairly large geometry buffers which
      the engine copies all geometry into every frame [1].
    </p>

    <p>
      Since I already had this system of copying data onto the video card, I
      decided to reuse it for rendering text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, after that decision was made, a sane thought process would have been
      "Gee, maybe I should use this system in the same way that the rest of the
      codebase uses it, because that's how it works".
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, this went though my head "Gee, I think I'll add an artificial
      constraint that the geometry buffers should be really tiny (1 kilobyte),
      just for fun".
    </p>

    <p>
      So, now our text renderer draws stuff in multiple passes due to the tiny
      geometry buffers, which is bad news for transparent stuff (aka: text).
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, turning the 'discard factor' up results in better-looking text
      edges, but at the cost of also writing to the depth buffer, which we make
      use of to keep windows stacking properly.  This means if the window
      background gets drawn after the text it encloses (the likely case), whatever
      was behind the window will bleed through the edges of the text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Infinite sadness :((
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem has two solutions:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Turn up the geometry buffer sizes such that they never fill on a single
      frame, and draw opaque geometry before transparent geometry.
      (Like any normal person would have done in the first place)</li>

      <li>Do two passes over the render-command buffer [2] with small geometry
      buffers, flushing as normal when they fill, drawing opaque geometry on
      the first pass, and drawing transparent geometry on the second pass.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I decided to do (1) for the moment to make sure my assessment of the
      situation is correct, and we'll tackle (2) for extra profit later.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, to recap, to get the engine to support transparency for 2D geometry
      we just multiplied a couple buffer sizes by 20,000 (which is ~100x
      overkill) and everything magically worked.  It's also worth noting that
      this could probably be a long-term solution.  In totality the draw
      buffers are ~16 megabytes (aka: not that big), which accounts for 100x
      more geometry than the renderer ever draws at this moment.  By flushing
      every time we draw a window, we could push that multiplier to ~400x and
      have no visual artifacts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a big fan of wasting memory when it buys you something, but in this
      case it should be pretty easy to use 16 kilobytes instead of 16
      megabytes, so we might as well do that.  We're craftspeople after all!
    </p>

    <h3> Issue 2: AA'd pixels getting discarded by the shader</h3>
    <p>
      We've seen this line already:
    </p>

    <code> if (bitmapTexel.a &lt; 0.5f) { discard; }</code>

    <p>
      Which is partially causing the bad aliasing behavior we're seeing.  Now
      that the renderer isn't drawing opaque stuff overtop of our transparent
      stuff, we can just delete this line!  Wee!
    </p>

    <h3> Issue 3: Glyph texels stored in a 3D texture instead of 2D texture array</h3>
    <p>
      The other issue that was contributing to aliasing is that the glyph
      textures were being stored in a 3D texture and retrieved with
      texelFetch() instead of texutre()!  This means that the texels were not
      getting the normal bi-linear filtering treatment expected at such a
      high-quality establishemnt.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was also an easy fix, change the code that allocated the textures to ask
      for a GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY instead of GL_TEXTURE_3D, and change the
      texelFetch() to texture().  Looking back I have no idea why I used a 3D
      texture in the first place.
    </p>


    <h3>Final Boss : Drawing infinite text with 1kb of geometry buffer</h3>
    <p>
      This actually turned out to be a bit trickier than I expected.  The
      overarching class of issues I ran into were that the layout engine assumed it
      only ever did a single pass over the render-command buffer and, in a few
      places, it modified elements directly, which resulted in some double-counting
      during the layout step of the second render pass.
    </p>

    <p>
    [1] Yes, this is an unusual way for a renderer to work.  I'll probably rewrite
    it at some point using a more conventional method, but I like trying weird
    ideas I come up with.
    </p>

    <p>
    [2] The render-command buffer is a buffer of tagged-union values that describe
    the stuff our application wants to render.  I may write about it in more detail
    in the future.
