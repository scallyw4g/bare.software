    <h1>Improving Bonsai text rendering - Part 1</h1>
    <h2>An adventure in anti-aliasing</h2>

    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
      The spoils of this adventure are the sweet, sweet anti-aliased pixels on
      the borders of text.  If you're looking for a harrowing tale of riches
      and glory, I'd suggest a good high-fantasy novel.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      After an initial pass on text rendering in Bonsai, there were glyphs on the screen!
    </p>

    <p>
      Granted, they look like they were drawn by Windows in 1990.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, that's being generous.  In 1990, Windows looked quite a bit better than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Surely we can do better!
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The font rasterizer I wrote does a pretty good job of producing nice, AA'd
      glyph bitmaps, however, the engine itself was doing a very poor job of
      actually putting those glyphs on the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day I found myself fafing (read: working) on the 2D layout system and
      spuriously commented out this line of shader code:
    </p>

    <code> if (bitmapTexel.a &lt; 0.5f) { discard; }</code>

    <p>
      The text all of a sudden looked INCREDIBLE!  At least compared to just a
      moment ago.
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/good_text_aliasing.png"></img>

    <p>
      So, the decision was made.  My next task would be to cleanup text rendering.
    </p>

    <h2>Issues</h2>
    <p>
      There were three main issues contributing to aliasing, which we'll
      deconstruct further:

      <ol>
        <li>The drawing code didn't properly support transparency (very bad, no good, don't do this)</li>
        <li>The transparent AA'd pixels were gettind discarded by the fragment shader</li>
        <li>The glyph textures were stored in a 3D texture, instead of 2D texture array</li>
      </ol>
    </p>


    <h3> Issue 1: Supporting transparency </h3>
    <p>
      The root cause of the aliasing behavior is the 2D renderer did not
      support transparency in any real way.  Instead of doing it the "real way"
      on my first pass, I decided to quickly hack in something that would
      achieve the goal of drawing text, quality be damned.  Thus, this line was
      born:
    </p>

    <code> if (bitmapTexel.a &lt; 0.5f) { discard; }</code>

    <p>
      This line discards any texel that's less than 50% opaque, which partly
      explains the aliasing.  But, you may ask, why not just turn that down to
      0.001%?  Furthermore, what happens if you just delete that line entirely?
      Surely we shouldn't need such weirdness in this fine establishment?!
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll take a look at some different text to demonstrate the problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the discard threshold set very low (0.001f):
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/partial_text_clipping_through_background.png"></img>
    <p>
      Notice the bleeding in "RenderWorldToGBuffer"
    </p>

    <p>
      And with the discard off entirely:
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/full_text_clipping_through_background.png"></img>

    <p>
      Obviously, the background bleeding through the edges of text (or the
      entire quad!) is objectionable.  This happens because the text renderer
      uses a depth buffer to ensure windows stack properly.  If the window
      background gets drawn after the text it encloses (the likely case),
      whatever was behind the window will bleed through the transparent parts
      of the glyph.  Certainly not something we folk of such eminence and grace
      should tolerate!  So, what's a programmer to do?
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, the answer lies somewhat hidden, but is related to how Bonsai
      copies memory to the video card.  It uses glMapBuffer to reserve fairly
      large geometry buffers which the engine copies all geometry into every
      frame [1].
    </p>

    <p>
      Since I already had this system of copying data onto the video card for
      the 3D renderer, I decided to reuse it for rendering text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, after that decision was made, a normal person would have thought:
      "Gee, maybe I should use this system in the same way that the rest of the
      codebase uses it, because that's how it works".
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, this went though my head: "Gee, I think I'll add an artificial
      constraint that the buffers should be really tiny (1 kilobyte), just for
      fun".
    </p>

    <p>
      So, now our text renderer draws geometry in multiple passes due to the
      tiny buffers, which is bad news for transparent stuff (aka: text).
    </p>

    <p>
      Infinite sadness :((
    </p>

    <h3> Solutions </h3>
    <p>
      This problem has two solutions:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Turn up the geometry buffer sizes such that they never fill on a single
      frame, and draw opaque geometry before transparent geometry.
      (Like any normal person would have done in the first place)</li>

      <li>Do two passes over the render-command buffer [2] with small geometry
      buffers, flushing as normal when they fill, drawing opaque geometry on
      the first pass, and drawing transparent geometry on the second pass.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I decided to do (1) for the moment to make sure my assessment of the
      situation is correct, and we'll tackle (2) for extra profit later.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, to recap, to get the engine to support transparency for 2D geometry
      we just multiplied a couple buffer sizes by 20,000 (which is ~100x
      overkill) and everything magically worked.
    </p>


    <p>
      Unfortunately for us, this is not a long-term solution.  In totality the
      draw buffers are now ~120 megabytes (aka: much bigger than a few kilobytes),
      which accounts for 100x more geometry than the renderer ever draws at
      this moment.  We could do some tricks to get the memory usage down, but
      why waste time doing tricks when doing it right isn't that hard in the
      first place?  We're craftspeople after all!  Do it right!
    </p>

    <h3> Issue 2: AA'd pixels getting discarded by the shader</h3>
    <p>
      We've seen this line already:
    </p>

    <code> if (bitmapTexel.a &lt; 0.5f) { discard; }</code>

    <p>
      Which is partially causing the bad aliasing behavior we're seeing.
    </p>

    <h3> Solution </h3>
    <p>
      Now that the renderer isn't drawing opaque stuff overtop of our transparent
      stuff, we can just delete this line!  Wee!
    </p>

    <h3> Issue 3: Glyph texels stored in a 3D texture instead of 2D texture array</h3>
    <p>
      The other issue that was contributing to aliasing is that the glyph
      textures were being stored in a 3D texture and retrieved with
      texelFetch() instead of texutre()!  This means that the texels were not
      getting the normal bi-linear filtering treatment expected at such a
      high-quality establishemnt.
    </p>

    <h3> Solution </h3>
    <p>
      This was also an easy fix, change the code that allocated the textures to ask
      for a GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY instead of GL_TEXTURE_3D, and change the
      texelFetch() to texture().  Looking back I have no idea why I used a 3D
      texture in the first place.
    </p>

    <h2> Result </h2>
    <p>
      Looking good!  Nice AA'd edges and no bleeding artifacts!

    <h2>Final Boss : Drawing infinite text with 1kb of geometry buffer</h2>
    <p>
      This actually turned out to be a bit trickier than I expected.  The
      overarching class of issues I ran into were that the layout engine
      assumed it only ever did a single pass over the render-command buffer
      and, in a few places, it modified elements directly, which resulted in
      some double-counting during the layout step of the second render pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay tuned for the conclusion of this epic adventure in Part 2!

    <p>
    [1] Yes, this is an unusual way for a renderer to work.  I'll probably rewrite
    it at some point using a more conventional method, but I like trying weird
    ideas I come up with.
    </p>

    <p>
    [2] The render-command buffer is a buffer of tagged-union values that describe
    the stuff our application wants to render.  I may write about it in more detail
    in the future.
