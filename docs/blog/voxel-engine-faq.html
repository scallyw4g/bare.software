      While I've certainly been programming a while (10 years professionally),
      I'm definitely not perfect, and I'm continually learning to be better.
      Interpret these answers as guidance I would have given my younger self,
      if I were blessed with a time-machine.  YMMV.

    <h3>Q: How do I generate the exterior faces for voxels on the borders of a chunk?</h3>
    <p>
      The way I solve this is, at generation time (when you initialize a new
      chunk), initialize a chunk whos dimention is 2 voxels larger that the one
      you want to produce.  If you do this, and you can populate that 'halo'
      with appropriate data, you can generate all the information you need to
      build the mesh from that single buffer.  This approach has the attractive
      quality of operating on a single block of memory, and thus is easily run
      on multiple threads.  Once the mesh is generated, you have to copy the
      interior voxels out of the larger chunk you initialized which are the
      voxels you actually need to store.

    <h3>Q: How should I store my world chunks?</h3>
    <p>
      I see a lot of folks around recommending using a hashtable to store chunks,
      keyed by the world position of the chunk.  This can be a good idea, or it
      can be a really bad idea, depending on the details.  If you're using C++
      and you reach for std::unordered_map, stop right now.  That datastructure
      has an almost comically large performance cliff when it rebalanaces, which
      you desperately want to avoid.  A better idea is to write your own hashtable
      that uses local probing.  Another option is to set the size of the world
      to a statically known value at compile time (maybe 32x32x8 chunks?) and
      allocate a table that is exactly the volume of that area, then you can
      perfectly map the chunks you want to render into their respective slot
      in that 'table'.  Yet another method is to use a persistant octree (as in,
      not rebuilt on every frame), as the storage medium.  IIRC this is what
      Avoyd does.

    <p>
      What I do is slightly weird.  I have a pair of local-probing hashtables
      that I double buffer.  Every frame I re-insert every chunk into a freshly
      cleared hashtable that acts as the source of truth for what's in the world
      that frame.  This doesn't scale particularly well (IIRC 64k chunks is
      about the upper limit), but it's simple, has a stable cost, and allows
      for easily resizing the visible region into the world across frames, which
      is an appropriate tradeoff for my engine.
