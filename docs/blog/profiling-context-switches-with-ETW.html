    <h1>Profiling Context Switch Timing with ETW</h1>
    <h2>Or, spelunking in "The Worst Docs Ever Written"</h2>

    <p>
      I'm hardly the first person to call ETW the "Worst API Ever Made".  That
      honor belongs to the venerable
      <a target='_blank' href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0025">Casey Muratori</a>, who
      wrote about it back in 2014.  While he was writing that, I was but a wee
      little programmer who didn't know ETW existed, let alone what a context
      switch was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I'd like to propose here that ETW has gotten, shockingly, even
      worse than it was back then.  Not because the API has changed much
      (although there are some subtle differences), but because there are new,
      improved ways of using ETW, and the documentation for using said new
      services impoverishes ones ability to get to the bottom of using the 'old'
      stuff, ie. kernel tracing.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the way, the 'new' ways you use ETW are unilaterally: "Don't use it
      directly, use this system that calls it for you instead."  This has
      resulted in "The Worst Documentation Ever Written".  And really, who
      would be surprised?  Shouldn't the worst API also have the worst
      documentation?
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyway, let's dive in.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Now, you may be wondering, why on earth would anyone want to know when
      the scheduler performed a context switch?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the full answer to that question is well beyond the scope of this
      article, but suffice to say context switches cost cycles, and arguably
      more importantly, the scheduler is likely to set up the next thread with
      a cache that's not well primed for it's workload.  So, the short answer
      is, more context switches may equal slower program, but sometimes not.
      Straightforward, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      I want this information so I can see exactly when, and on which cores, my
      program is running.  Here's a screenshot of a typical frame from a game
      I'm working on.  There's stuff going on, but a notable lack of
      context-switch information.  Let's remedy that.
    </p>

    <img class="full-width" src="/assets/call_graph_no_context_switches.png"></img>

    <p>
      If you haven't read <a target='_blank' href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0025">Casey's blog/rant</a>
      on ETW, now's a good time to at least skim that.  It's a good read.  From
      here on out I'll assume you're familiar with starting a kernel tracing
      session with ETW.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter One: The obvious path</h2>
    <p>
      So, once we've started a tracing session, opened the session with the
      kernel provider, and started processing events (with <code class="inline">StartTrace()</code>,
      <code class="inline">OpenTrace()</code> and <code class="inline">ProcessTrace()</code>
      respectively), things are looking good.  All that's left to do is
      interpret the events, and then we can draw some context switches to the
      screen!  Sounds easy enough .. let's open up the
      <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/consuming-events">documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the preamble on that page is stuff we've learned by reading
      Casey's post (or, at your peril, the MSDN docs).  Near the bottom there's
      a paragraph that reads:
      <quote>
        For an example that shows how to consume events published source using a
        manifest, MOF, or TMF files, see
        <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/retrieving-event-data-using-tdh">Retrieving Event Data Using TDH</a>.
        Note that beginning with Windows Vista, you should use the trace data
        helper (TDH) functions to consume events.
      </quote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, I don't know if context switch events are 'manifest', MOF, or TMF
      events, or wtf <italic>TDH</italic> is, but whatever.  That quote says we
      should use TDH because we're running a modern version of Windows.  Let's
      go read <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/retrieving-event-data-using-tdh">Retrieving Event Data Using TDH</a>.
      real quick.
    </p>

    <p>
      That page links to four examples, <strong>totalling 2811 lines</strong> of C++. Fuck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Okay, back to square one; I'm not adding that to my codebase, and I'm
      sure as hell not trying to understand it deeply unless it's my only option.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter Two: The hidden path</h2>
    <p>
      Let's try and figure out what type of event a context switch is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, it turned out to be impossible to search MSDN for the
      <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/cswitch">CSwitch</a>
      struct (unless you knew the name already), but Google turned it up right away.
    </p>
    <p>
      From MSDN:
    </p>

      <quote>The following syntax is simplified from MOF code.</quote>
      <code>[EventType{36}, EventTypeName{"CSwitch"}]
class CSwitch : Thread_V2
{
  uint32 NewThreadId;
  uint32 OldThreadId;
  sint8  NewThreadPriority;
  sint8  OldThreadPriority;
  uint8  PreviousCState;
  sint8  SpareByte;
  sint8  OldThreadWaitReason;
  sint8  OldThreadWaitMode;
  sint8  OldThreadState;
  sint8  OldThreadWaitIdealProcessor;
  uint32 NewThreadWaitTime;
  uint32 Reserved;
};</code>

    <p>
      Well, that looks like what we want .. I guess context switches are MOF events.
    </p>

    <p>
      As it turns out, MOF events are the oldest type of ETW event.  That
      tracks, so let's go back to the page on 
      <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/consuming-events">Consuming Events</a>,
      to see if
      there are any more clues.  Oh, and hopefully we don't have to deal with
      all the base-classes for this event, because it's the fourth level deep
      in the event hierarchy.  Yikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, back on
      <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/consuming-events">Consuming Events</a>,
      literally the last line on the page is another link:
      <quote>
        For an example that shows how to consume events published using MOF, see 
        <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/retrieving-event-data-using-mof">Retrieving Event Data Using MOF.</a>
      </quote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Great, that's exactly what we want to do! Let's check it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's some preamble that has some good pointers there, like:
      <quote>All the kernel events use MOF to publish the format of the event data.</quote>
    </p>

    <p>
      So far so good! And some (maybe misleading) information like:
    </p>

    <quote>Because ETW does not force an alignment between event data values, typecasting or assigning the value directly from a buffer may cause an alignment fault; you should not create a structure from the MOF class and try to use it to consume event data. </quote>

    <p>
      Okay, kinda weird, but I guess in a very general eventing system like ETW it's good to be memory efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
    And then.. you find it.  Another <strong>1348 lines</strong> of glorious example code.  Fuck.  Why the fucking .. <strong>fuck</strong>!
    </p>

    <p>
      Surely the scheduler (who's presumably responsible for writing these
      context switch events) isn't doing anything so insanely convoluted.  The
      Windows scheduler was written at a time when we had less cycles to waste,
      so it <strong>must</strong> be efficient, right?!
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter Three: The fools path</h2>
    <p>
      Well, we can come back to the example code as a last resort, but I'm not
      convinced that's the only way to get what we want.  Let's take a closer
      look at the structure of the actual event we're receiving.
    </p>

<code>struct EVENT_RECORD
{
  EVENT_HEADER                     EventHeader;
  ETW_BUFFER_CONTEXT               BufferContext;
  USHORT                           ExtendedDataCount;
  USHORT                           UserDataLength;
  PEVENT_HEADER_EXTENDED_DATA_ITEM ExtendedData;
  PVOID                            UserData;
  PVOID                            UserContext;
};</code>

<code>struct EVENT_HEADER
{
  USHORT           Size;
  USHORT           HeaderType;
  USHORT           Flags;
  USHORT           EventProperty;
  ULONG            ThreadId;
  ULONG            ProcessId;
  LARGE_INTEGER    TimeStamp;
  GUID             ProviderId;
  EVENT_DESCRIPTOR EventDescriptor;
  union {
    struct {
      ULONG KernelTime;
      ULONG UserTime;
    };
    ULONG64 ProcessorTime;
  };
  GUID             ActivityId;
};
</code>

<code>struct EVENT_DESCRIPTOR
{
  USHORT    Id;
  UCHAR     Version;
  UCHAR     Channel;
  UCHAR     Level;
  UCHAR     Opcode;
  USHORT    Task;
  ULONGLONG Keyword;
};</code>

<code>struct ETW_BUFFER_CONTEXT
{
  union {
    struct {
      UCHAR ProcessorNumber;
      UCHAR Alignment;
    };
    USHORT ProcessorIndex;
  };
  USHORT LoggerId;
};</code>

<code>struct EVENT_HEADER_EXTENDED_DATA_ITEM {
  USHORT    Reserved1;
  USHORT    ExtType;
  struct {
    USHORT Linkage : 1;
    USHORT Reserved2 : 15;
  };
  USHORT    DataSize;
  ULONGLONG DataPtr;
};</code>

    <p> Woah, that's a fat struct.  Oh, and it's scattered across 5 documentation pages.  </p>
    <p> Oh, and the type names aren't clickable; you have to go find the links in the member descriptions.  </p>
    <p> Oh, and that's not all the definitions; I omittted GUID and LARGE_INTEGER which are, in fact, more structs.  </p>
    <p> FML </p>
    <p> Okay, breathe.  </p>

    <p>
      Let's take a look at a screenshot of one of those bad boys expanded in
      <a target='_blank' href="https://remedybg.handmade.network/">RemedyBG</a>.
    </p>

    <img class="full-width" src="/assets/remedy_etw_event.png"></img>

    <p>
      There are a few interesting values in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, both <code class="inline">ThreadId</code> and
      <code class="inline">ProcessId</code> are <code class="inline">ULONG_MAX</code>,
      which are not very helpful values.  I believe that is something that's
      changed since Casey wrote his article; you used to get the ProcessId and
      ThreadId, but it appears that's no longer true.  We now have to dig for
      that data, and in particular ProcessId is hidden behind another syscall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another interesting value is <code class="inline">Opcode=36</code>.  That
      happens to be the <code class='inline'>EventType</code> that the
      <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/cswitch">CSwitch</a>
      struct specifies .. so I guess this might be a context switch event ..?
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <code class='inline'>BufferContext</code> object we get the
      <code class='inline'>ProcessorIndex</code>, which is something
      useful to know.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell you which physical core
      it's on; getting that information is a story for another blog post.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then, you turn the corner and, halleleuja, would you look at that, dress me in velvet and
      spank my bottom, there are <code class="inline">UserDataLength=24</code> and
      <code class="inline">UserData=&#60;pointer-looking-thing&#62;</code>!!  And
      <code class="inline">UserDataLength</code> just happens to match the size of the
      <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/cswitch">CSwitch</a>
      struct!  If you turn on <code class="inline">#pragma push(pack, 1)</code>, of course.
      Anyway .. fuck yeah!!  Let's get to casting!
    </p>

    <p>
      To be safe, we should probably memcpy because of the alignment issue the
      docs mentioned earlier, but I did try casting, and it seems to work.
    </p>

<code>context_switch_event *SystemEvent =
                   (context_switch_event*)Event->UserData;</code>

    <p> Versus: </p>

<code>context_switch_event SystemEvent;

MemCopy( (u8*)Event->UserData,
         (u8*)&SystemEvent,
         sizeof(context_switch_event));</code>

    <p> Since both work, and this code only runs on dev machines, I'm just going to cast for now.  </p>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>
      So, in closing, I spent an entire day chasing my tail around MSDN, read
      through almost 4500 lines of OOPs-y example code for clues, ended up
      looking for other codebases that do this (big surprise, I couldn't find
      any) and, in the end, had to make educated guesses by looking at the
      runtime values I was seeing.
    </p>

    <p> <strong>THIS WAS ALL LOOKING FOR A SINGLE LINE OF CODE</strong> </p>

    <p>
      Surely, Microsoft, other people want to do this without adding thousands
      of lines of code to their projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lesson here is, don't trust the MSDN documentation much, and
      certainly don't take the example code, or their recommendations, as gospel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feel free to take a look at the code that I wrote to do this in
      <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai_debug/blob/master/headers/win32_etw.cpp">win32_etw.cpp</a>.
      That should be more-or-less everything you need to get started.  Happy context-switching!
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, I'll leave you with some pretty pictures of our hard-won context
      switch data on the screen.  The small colored bar above the fat colored
      bars indicates which logical core the thread is running on at any given
      time.  A gap in the thin bars means the thread's been swapped out!
