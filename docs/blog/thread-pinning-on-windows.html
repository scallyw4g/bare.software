    <h1>Pinning worker threads to physical cores on Windows</h1>

    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>
      After Googling around for a nominal amount of time, I couldn't find any
      resources that told me exactly what I wanted to know.  After goofing
      around for a couple hours, I decided to write down what I learned in the
      hopes that it'll help someone else looking for this in the future.
      Probably myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      One resource I did find that has some information and pseudo-code that
      looks kind-of similar to what we want is on the Intel site.  Search for
      <code class='inline'>GetLogicalProcessorInformation</code> on this
      <a href="https://www.intel.cn/content/www/cn/zh/developer/articles/guide/12th-gen-intel-core-processor-gamedev-guide.html">Intel article</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      First of all, why would one want to pin a thread to a physical core?
      Well the answer, as is becoming usual around here, is performance.  If
      you tell the OS to only schedule your thread on logical cores hosted on
      the same physical core, it has a much higher chance of waking up with a
      cache primed for it's workload.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we continue, a word of caution; doing this requires (reasonably)
      careful profiling, and comes with a list of caveats.  I won't go through
      them all here, but the most important one to keep in mind is that if you
      start more worker threads than you have logical cores, you're probably
      going to have a bad time.  This is sort-of universally true, but becomes
      more important as you get further down the optimization rabbit-hole.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, without further ado, let's see the code.
    </p>

    <h3>Main</h3>
    <p>
      The first step is to count the number of physical cores on your machine
      using <code class='inline'>GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx</code>.
    </p>

<code>SYSTEM_INFO sysinfo;
GetSystemInfo(&sysinfo);

unsigned long LogicalProcessorCount = (u32)sysinfo.dwNumberOfProcessors;

unsigned long AllocatedSize =
    sizeof(SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX)*LogicalProcessorCount;

SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX *RelationshipBuffer =
    (SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX*)Allocate(AllocatedSize);

if (GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx(
        RelationProcessorCore,
        RelationshipBuffer,
        &AllocatedSize)
  )
{
  // Count physical processors
  u32 PhysicalCoreCount = 0;

  SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX *Info = RelationshipBuffer;
  for (u32 Offset = 0; Offset < AllocatedSize; Offset += Info->Size)
  {
    Info = (SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX*)((u8*)Info + Info->Size);
    Assert(Info->Processor.GroupCount == 1);
    PhysicalCoreCount++;
  }
}
else
{
  SoftError("GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx Failed");
}</code>

    <p>
      There's a fair bit going on here, so I'll point out the important bits:
    </p>

    <p>
    The first argument to <code class='inline'>GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx()</code> is a symbolic
      constant; "RelationshipType".  There are a few values you can pass, but
      the one we're interested in says "I'm interested in logical processors
      that share a physical core."
    </p>

    <p>
      The other two parameters are the buffer it's going to write the results
      to, and the size of the buffer.  It returns a nonzero value on success.
    </p>

    <p>
      If that function succeeds, we step through the buffer it returns to us
      and tally up the number of cores we've got.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, with that information, we can create one thread per physical core,
      and use "<code class='inline'>SetThreadAffinityMask</code>" to pin it to
      only logical cores that share a physical core.
    </p>

<code>SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX *ProcessorInfo = RelationshipBuffer;

for (u32 ThreadIndex = 0; ThreadIndex < PhysicalCoreCount; ++ThreadIndex)
{
  HANDLE ThreadHandle = CreateThread(0, 0, ThreadMain, 0, 0, 0);
  SetThreadAffinityMask(ThreadHandle, ProcessorInfo->Processor.GroupMask->Mask);

  ProcessorInfo = (SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX*)
                    ((u8*)ProcessorInfo + ProcessorInfo->Size);
}
</code>

    <p>
      That's all pretty straight-forward, with the exception of the second
      argument to <code class='inline'>SetThreadAffinityMask</code>, which is
      where the magic happens.  That pile of accesses is for a 64-bit bitmask
      representing which logical cores belong to that physical processor, which
      is exactly what <code class='inline'>SetThreadAffinityMask</code> expects
      to be fed.  Neat-o gang!
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      So there you have it.  Go forth and prosper, pinning threads to your
      physical cores as you do!
    </p>

    <p>
      And I'll leave you, good reader, with a pretty picture showing frames of
      a game with and without pinning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I left the main thread unpinned for this screenshot, and the worker
      threads are pinned.  Notice the small colorful bars which represent which
      logical core a thread is running on.  If you zoom in, you can see Thread
      0 (the main thread) gets swapped around onto 6 different cores!
    </p>

    <p>
      The net result was a noticible, but somewhat marginal savings on frame
      time, both at rest and under high-load.  Here we see a difference of
      ~0.8ms/frame at idle.  I believe pinning may have also reduced frame time
      variance, though 120 frames (the number tracked by this output) is not
      enough resolution to say with much confidance.
