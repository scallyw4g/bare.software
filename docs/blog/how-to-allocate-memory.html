<h2>How to allocate memory without a GC</h2>

<p>
  I fairly frequently run into people that hold the opinion that manual memory
  and lifetime management is some massive intractable problem that's far too
  difficult for mere mortals to cope with.

  In the vast majority of cases that's untrue.  In this post I'd like to
  enumerate the cases that present problems when manually managing memory, and
  its lifetime.
</p>


<h2>Case 1: (Truly) Dynamically sized data allocated on multiple threads</h2>
<p>
  While the number of tasks that truly require dynamic heap allocation is
  small, it is non-zero, so we have to be prepared to handle it somehow.

  One of the cases I've run into that requires a heap is allocating geometry
  data.  Typically, 3D geometry data has an unpredictable lifetime; it could be
  on the screen for a handful of frames, the majority of frames, or for the
  entire playsession.  The size of data also varies greatly.  Some geometries
  require a handful of triangles, some are tens or hundreds-of-thousands.  For
  offline rendering (or, indeed, advanced real-time renderers) it's not
  uncommon to reach into the hundreds-of-millions or billions of triangles.

<p>
  This problem has N solutions I've been able to think of, which have various
  tradeoffs discussed below
</p>

<h3>Solution 1: Allocate all memory on the main thread</h3>
<p>
  The easiest solution is to avoid the problem.

  Pros.
    Main thread can trivially free memory when it collects dead entities

  Cons.
    Have to know how much memory to allocate up-front.  If loading assets from
    disk we might have to eat the cost of opening the file and figuring out
    how much memory to allocate on the main thread.  Very bad, not good.
      Soln.
        Have an in-memory 'asset-index' that maps assets to their sizes
</p>

<h3>Solution 2: Allocate from worker thread using thread_local heap allocator </h3>
<p>
  Pros.
    Entire asset load happens off the main thread

  Cons.
    Each thread needs their own heap allocator; wastes space
    Allocations must be freed on the thread they were allocated on; tricky
</p>


<h3>Solution 3: Allocate from threads using mt-safe heap allocator</h3>
<p>
  Pros.
    Entire asset load happens off the main thread

  Cons.
    mt-safe-ing the allocator makes it slow
</p>
